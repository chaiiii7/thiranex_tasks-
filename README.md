TASK 1 introduction to cybersecurity and password checker
A password checker in Python is created by defining password strength criteria, 
like minimum length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. 
Then, a function is written to check if a given password meets these criteria, 
using string methods and regular expressions to validate the password against each rule.



TASK 2  basic network security
Wireshark, like Ethereal, is used to capture and analyze network traffic. It works by:

1.  Capturing Packets: Wireshark captures network packets from a network interface. It can monitor live network traffic or read packets from a saved capture file.
2.  Decoding Protocols: Once captured, Wireshark decodes the packets, interpreting the data based on various network protocols (like HTTP, TCP, DNS, etc.).
3.  Filtering and Analysis: It allows users to filter packets based on criteria like source/destination IP addresses, protocols, or specific content. Users can then analyze the filtered packets to diagnose network issues, security threats, or understand network behavior.
